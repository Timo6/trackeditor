Vamos is an automotive simulation framework with an emphasis on
thorough physical modeling and good C++ design. Vamos includes a
real-time, first-person, 3D driving application.

What You Need
* Plib >= v1.4.0.  http://plib.sourceforge.net
* SimGear >= v0.3.0.  http://www.simgear.org
* libsigc++ >= v1.2.0.  http://libsigc.sourceforge.net
* OpenGL
* An accelerated video card.
* A joystick is highly recommended.

Build with the usual ./configure; make sequence.  You can run the sim
from the vamos directory without installing.

Use the joystick buttons for shifting.  Give it some gas when shifting
out of neutral or you'll stall and you'll have to press the `S' key to
re-start the engine.

Here are some important key bindings
* a  Place the car back at the starting line.
* r  Place the car back on the road.
* ,  Pan the view left.
* .  Pan the view right.
* s  Start the engine after a stall.
* f  Fill the fuel tank.
* p  Pause the application.
* q  Exit the application.
* F9 Cycle through the views.

Here are the bindings for driving by keyboard
* Up     Throttle.
* Down   Brake.
* Left	 Turn left.
* Right  Turn right.
* Insert Shift up.
* Delete Shift down.
* Home   Clutch.

You can choose a particular car with the `-c <car>' or `--car=<car>'
option, where <car> is one of
* `default-car' (same as `GT')
* `F1'
* `F1-1967',
* `front-drive'
* `GT'
* `trainer'

The track may be chosen with the `-t <track>'
or `--track=<track>' option, where <track> is one of 
* `default-track' (same as `Peanut')
* Albert_Park
* Bahrain
* Catalunya
* default-track
* drag
* Hockenheimring
* Hungaroring
* Imola
* Indianapolis
* Interlagos
* jump
* Kyalami
* Laguna_Seca
* Magny-Cours
* Monaco
* Monza
* Mosport
* Nurburgring
* Peanut
* Road_Atlanta
* Sepang
* Shanghai
* Silverstone
* skid_pad
* Spa
* Suzuka
* Villeneuve

See the Texinfo documentation for more details.

I've tried Vamos on GNU/Linux and Win32+CygWin.  The simulation is
slow and textures are wrong on Win32.  I don't know where the problem
is.

Please let me know how it works for you.
